This module implements the core functionality of olpc-os-builder.
You don't want to exclude it.

[base] options:

- versioned_fs (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable the "upgradeable" /versions-based filesystem layout.

- prepopulate_run (default 1)
Only applicable when building a versioned filesystem layout.
This will cause the /versions/run tree to be populate with a link-farm
from the image in /versions/pristine. This will be done at first-boot time
otherwise, but given that it takes a minute or more, it is a fair improvement
to do it at build time.

- make_iso (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable generation of a .iso file in the output directory.
This .iso can be used on a regular system as a LiveCD.

- compress_iso (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable squashfs compression of the filesystem on the .iso LiveCD.
This will increase the speed of the build, but the resultant .iso will be
about 3 times as big.

- make_tree_tarball (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable the generation of the LZMA-compressed filesystem tree
tarball
