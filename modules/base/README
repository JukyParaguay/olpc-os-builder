This module implements the core functionality of olpc-os-builder.
You don't want to exclude it.

[base] options:

- versioned_fs (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable the "upgradeable" /versions-based filesystem layout.

- prepopulate_run (default 1)
Only applicable when building a versioned filesystem layout.
This will cause the /versions/run tree to be populate with a link-farm
from the image in /versions/pristine. This will be done at first-boot time
otherwise, but given that it takes a minute or more, it is a fair improvement
to do it at build time.

- make_iso (default 0)
Set to 1 to enable generation of a .iso file in the output directory.
This .iso may or may not function on a regular system as a LiveCD.

- compress_iso (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable squashfs compression of the filesystem on the .iso LiveCD.
This will increase the speed of the build, but the resultant .iso will be
about 3 times as big.

- make_tree_tarball (default 1)
Set to 0 to disable the generation of the LZMA-compressed filesystem tree
tarball

- python_optimize (default 2)
When 0, pyc files will be generated for all Python code in the OS build.
When set to 1, basic optimizations will be enabled, and pyo files will be
generated instead of pyc.
When set to 2, the effects will be the same as 1 except docstrings will
be discarded when generating pyc files.
